## Data Science Internship Projects

### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:**  
Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset includes information about individual passengers, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Survival status

**Description:**  
This classic beginner project utilizes the Titanic dataset to create a predictive model. The goal is to analyze the given data and develop a model that can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on their characteristics.

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

**Objective:**  
Predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset contains historical movie data, including:
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- User or critic ratings

**Description:**  
This project involves building a regression model to estimate movie ratings. Through data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning, the project aims to uncover the factors that influence movie ratings and develop a model that can accurately predict them.

### Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:**  
Classify iris flowers into species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

**Dataset:**  
The Iris dataset includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

**Description:**  
This introductory classification task involves training a machine learning model to distinguish between different species of iris flowers using their measurements. The goal is to accurately classify the flowers into their respective species based on the provided data.

### Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python

**Objective:**  
Forecast the sales amount of a product by analyzing various influencing factors.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset includes factors such as:
- Advertising expenditure
- Target audience segmentation
- Advertising platform selection

**Description:**  
Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize their strategies and maximize sales. This project uses machine learning techniques in Python to analyze data and predict future sales. By making informed decisions regarding advertising costs, businesses can enhance their advertising strategies and improve sales performance.

### Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset contains transaction data that needs to be:
- Preprocessed and normalized
- Handled for class imbalance
- Split into training and testing sets

**Description:**  
This project focuses on developing a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions. Techniques such as logistic regression or random forests are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and class imbalance issues are addressed using oversampling or undersampling methods.
